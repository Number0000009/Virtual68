# Virtual68
A simple 68K virtual platform for FUZIX bring up and similar purposes

We emulate a very simple platform with a simple serial interface, IDE hard
disc, timer, and some optional MMU, low memory trap and banking features
reflecting those found on some real boards.

To run

make

./makeprom

makedisk 1 disk.img	# makedisk is in the IDE repository

./makehello

./v68


At the moment there is a very simplistic boot "rom" which provides minimal
services via a jump table, and a simple command prompt (b boot r reset)

There are two reasons for Vrtual68 existing

1. It provides an extremely simple convenient bring up platform for FUZIX on a
68000

2. It contains a software implementation of the proposed ridiculously simple
MMU that never quite made the Atari ST series(*). One of the goals is to boot
FUZIX using that MMU and see if it actualy works out, before trying to do the
same on an FPGA 68K.
